# Visualisation-Sensing
Final Project for the Visualisation and Sensing Unit

This is a simple HTML website that presents my visualizations and documentation of the process of coming to my findings. I worked on the subject of Hearing Loss over the decades 1970-2010 and what might have possibly contributed to it.

You do need to install any libraries to run this; simply download the "Hearing Loss Data Visualisation" folder and run the index.html file in your browser.
