<h1>Physical Health and Music</h1>
<p>If you're a strong music enthusiast and like to keep up with 
    its culture and affairs, you probably share
    some of the aspects surrounding it with me.
    For instance, you are heavily engaged with atleast one
    music streaming platform - Spotify, Apple Music,
    Deezer, TIDAL, etc. - relying on it for all your
    go-to playlists, personalized recommendations for new
    releases, and everything else. You also attend live
    performances whenever you can. But if you're someone
    who observes the effect of loud music closely, you 
    probably understand the damage it yields on your ears.
    Unless generally nonchalant, you carry and wear ear protection
    at concerts, festivals, clubs, etc. 

    But as a frequent concertgoer myself, I would often be perplexed
    by the varying difference in people's behaviour towards loud music.
    Some were indifferent and would not wear any protection - seeminlgy
    tolerant of the loud sounds booming through the walls and our bodies.
    Some would eventually take a break after continuous dancing, complaining
    of numbness or tingling in the ears. A lot of times MCs or hosts  
    wouldn't mind the loudness levels as well, and I often felt as if
    I was the only one incapable of having a good tolerance to such loud music.
    <br><br>
    This narrative gave me the impetus to know a little more about hearing loss,
    especially within the context of music. Although, as most impairments or 
    diseases go, hearing loss isn't as popular a topic that's talked about, so
    I was aware of the research implications it had. Moreover, as mentioned
    previously, the discussion of loudness in music feels more buried than
    other popular discourses - production, fan engagement at venues, etc.
    <br><br>
    All in all, I decided to investigate hearing loss cases within the US & the
    UK, and tried to investigate the possible causes behind it.

    Having somewhat of a fair idea about the Loudness War (recorded 
    songs sounding increaingly loud overtime), as well as the 
        potential rave music scene, loud stadium rock concerts during
        the era of bands like AC/DC, I had these leads to track the
        potential contributions to hearing loss overtime. As a result, I
        also chose a similar period to study in: the 1970s to 2010.

    This was inclusive of the Loudness War era as well as eras of
    certain genre-popular concerts (raves).

    As per the regions - US and UK - I chose these countries since most data on music
    and genres relating to raves, the idea behind tours and concerts still remains a 
    rather traditionally western concept. My research journey would only be easier
    to explore if I followed certain biases, and I think fairness in the data
    and reveals/clues in the story were a cost I incurred. 

</p>

<p>
    First, I collected data on hearing loss in the US & the UK. The closest I  came
    to finding an accurate data source based on my needs were files on hearing impairments,
    and their rates in the US and UK from 1990-2010. This didn't cover the 70s and 80s,
    yet I still proceeded to plot the values on charts.

    
</p>

<img src="ukchart.png" alt="UK chart" width="600" height="400">


<p> I initially chose to display the number of cases in both the countries
    but realized the distribution gap between the two. The UK had a higher
report of cases which would mess up the scales if I were to compare them  
together, following which I chose to display rates.</p>

<img src="uschart.png" alt="UK chart" width="600" height="400">

<p> This chart below compares the rates of the two countries side by side:</p>

<img src="usukchart.png" alt="UK chart" width="600" height="400">

<br><br>
<p> Here, there is a sharp drop in rates in the UK from the year 2000. As 
    for the report of hearing loss cases alone, these could be the potential
    causes:

    <ul>
        <li>The general population might treat hearing loss as a
            casual problem that onsets with age, hence not being
            motivated enough to seek medical attention or help in the 
            first place. Yet this doesn't make sense as there cannot
            be such a sudden drop in people losing the wish to 
            report such problems; an attitude of indifference would've
            probably reflected from the beginning.

        </li>
        <li>The data I picked up asked me the cause of such hearing loss
            in order to filter out those specific results. I selected noise-induced
            hearing loss reasons but the filter inevitably selected other natural reasons.
            This might have skewed the data in some way - including non-noise induced reasons
            that do not show a clear picture of how many pure hearing loss cases were there.
            Still, I think it doesn't explain the drop. Especially keeping in mind how 
            dynamic ranges were only decreasing in music.
        </li>

      </ul>

    

</p>



<p>Now, I decided to do some data scraping and find out the trendline of dynamic ranges
    of albums over the original period of 1970-2010. I decided to choose each year's
    top 10 albums and find out the average DR of that year accordingly.
    For this, I had to do a lot of web scraping which was fun! 
    I had to do dig deep into the structure of webpages and problem solve a lot of times
    to extract and clean exactly the things I needed.

</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p> I also generated a csv file that stored all the top 10 albums in that year span.
    This ensured that I could use it later as a dataframe to ease further web scraping
    to find out the dynamic ranges of all those albums.
</p>

<img src="finalfile.png" alt="UK chart" width="390" height="500">

<p>After a lot of scraping and debugging, this was my plot of the average
    dynamic ranges of albums over the years 1970-2010:
</p>

<img src="drchart.png" alt="UK chart" width="600" height="400">
<p>
    As you can see, albums generally had higher average Dynamic Range until
    around the year 1992. There was a widespread compression of songs
    across records which destroyed the dynamic sound a lot of older
    cuts would have. 

</p>

<br><br>

<p>I made another graph which prefaces the hearing loss rates and dynamic ranges
    side by side.
</p>
<img src="finalchart.png" alt="UK chart" width="600" height="350">

<p>As you can see above, the scales still look very off. The above
    chart only displays the rates in the US (blue), but even after adding the
    UK results (in red), they
    are not visible as it is forced to sit behind the US' results in an effort to 
    combine everything together.

    This is also odd to make an inference from, since the chart that showed just the rates
    of the US cases was a positive, increasing trend line. Yet here, the line
    retains the shape of the UK trendline, despite showing in code that US' results
    are making the difference.
</p>
<img src="final2.png" alt="UK chart" width="600" height="350">

<p>I would like to draw a general conclusion that points to hearing loss rates
    increasing around the Loudness War era, but the hearing loss data itself
    presents a lot of loose ends to make a strong point in the end. 
</p>

<p>The addition of the decades 70s and 80s would've presented a bit more context
    to level out the rates in perspective. Right now, the standalone presentation
    of hearing loss data (despite a comparison to the dynamic ranges) seems
    arbitrary in terms of what could've caused it. For instance, the general
    uptrend of US cases could've been brought on by multiple factors: increase in
    population, more awareness around protecting one's ears, etc.
</p>

<p>From my dataset, I did do a comparison of the dynamic range  of a randomnly picked 
    track from the 70s
    and a track from the late 2000s, in order to illustrate the evident compression
    and increase in loudness of music overtime.
</p>
<img src="eltonj.png" alt="UK chart" width="800" height="200">
<img src="donuts.png" alt="UK chart" width="600" height="200">

<p> The track on the left is Elton John's "Mellow" (1972), where there is a varying distribution
    of peaks and lows in the audio graph. On the other hand, we have J Dilla's track
    "Diff'Rence", released in 2006. You can see the drastic compresion of the tracks
    since there is not much difference in the highs and lows; they are nearly the same.
    This does not produce a dynamic sound when listening to the track.
</p>

<p>But I had another observation while inspecting the audio graphs of tracks:
    the decrease in dynamic range overtime presumably constituted the original/
    standard
    CD releases of albums. When I was looking for an album from 2010 to compare the
    DR of, I noticed how different versions of the album also had different dynamic ranges.

    Take for example, Kanye West's album "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy".
    When looking at the results of the album's dynamic range, the vinyl version
    had a much higher DR than the standard CD.

</p>

<img src="mbdtf.png" alt="UK chart" width="950" height="400">
<p> The vinyl has an overall DR of 10, while the CD has 5, within the same year.
    Such observations made me realize that during an automated task of scraping,
    maybe the code picked up the inaccurate versions of albums and skewed the DR
    chart. In relation to hearing loss, this only furthers the idea that 
    there could be non-noise related causes for hearing loss. If the dynamic
    range of albums wasn't affected so as long as different versions provided
    good dynamic sounds, then pointing at the Loudness War as a prominent
    force behind hearing loss rates wouldn't make sense. Moreover, it isn't
    as if people do not use vinyl: if anything, it stands strong even in the
    age of streaming. Whilst CDs might have fizzled out in distribution, 
    many music lovers still keep turntables and collect vinyl records,  
    unaffected by streaming's influence.
</p>

<p>Even a prior assumption about rave music stands unfounded. This genre 
    categorization chart shows their popularity overtime. Dance and Electronic do not seem to make a 
    strong mark during the late 90s and early 2000s, as compared to 
    the Hip-Hop genre. There could be two things: while popular in
    the recorded music realm, live music still championed genres like
    Dance and Electronic that the chart doesn't show. The other factor could
    be relativity: in comparison to Hip-Hop, Dance & Electronic didn't
    make as much of an impact in popularity in that period. Yet, by itself,
    those genres still remained popular in reach
</p>

<img src="genres.jpeg" alt="UK chart" width="400" height="300">

<p>Some studies still favor the hypothesis that the Loudness War
 contributed to a significant amount of hearing loss in people
 across generations. The study "Temporal Trends in the Loudness of Popular Music over Six Decades"
paints a similar picture with its illustrations: (Loudness from personal
music players increasing overtime)

</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>An increase in the loudness of recorded music could have definitely pushed
    a general risk towards hearing loss from the late 2000s. But uncertainty
    around the sudden drop in the UK's hearing loss rates, and a general
    positive trend in the US' increasing rates still remains. A lot of factors
    went unaccounted for, whether the age group affected by the Loudness War
    was necessarily represented in those cases, if the occupation of the people
    in those cases suffered from occupational hazard (loud construction noise), etc.
    As a result, while a lot of things remain arbitrary, we realized that reduced
    dynamic ranges of tracks certainly impacted listening, enough to warrant
    studies and a proper "Loudness War" discourse around it.
